# Dependent Censoring
This repository includes the R code of the simulation study conducted by Vicky Gkika on methods to correct for dependent censoring in survival analysis. \
This study was carried out during her MSc thesis at Leiden University Medical Center, the Netherlands under the supervision of dr.ir. Nan van Geloven, Department of Biomedical Data Sciences.

**main:** generates the data in all scenarios, implements methods and outputs the performance metrics and the estimated curves \
**results:** generates plots and performance metrics of all scenarios \
**true_survival_curve:** two approaches of obtaining the true underlying survival curve of a population and comparisons
